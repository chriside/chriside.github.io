I've made progress on sourcing data for this:

**Historical daily weather data by county/parish** - Visualcrossing.com looks like my best bet. It has historical weather data that can be downloaded to .csv.

**Historical daily commodity price fluctuations** - Barchart.com should work for this. They have commodity prices, daily, back to 1/1/2000. Also weekly prices back to 1/1/1980. So that would be  a lot of historical data to work with.

**Historical harvests by county/parish** - I'm not sure where to find this, and I need that context so that I can focus my weather data pulls by location. I also need this information in order to weight weather effects on historical USA-domestic production. Maybe USDA will have this info?
